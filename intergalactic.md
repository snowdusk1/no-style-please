Please tune in to my live DJ mix show ["Intergalactic Wasabi Mix"](https://anonradio.net/author/snowdusk/) on [aNONradio.net](https://anonradio.net) every Saturday and Sunday, from 23:00 to 24:00 UTC. Click here for instructions on how to tune in.

I play all kinds of sub-genres of electronic dance music, both current and classic, but mostly classic. My favourite electronic dance music genres are house, acid house, techno, minimal techno, drum â€˜n bass, UK Garage, electro, breakbeats, Italo-disco, hi-NRG, space disco, EBM, just to name a few.

I also play musical genres other than electronic dance music as well. I am also the "secret" DJ behind ["THE DJ LUCAS THE ANARCHIST SHOW"](https://mastodon.sdf.org/@djlucas), ["Blast From The Past with DJ Daniel"](https://mastodon.sdf.org/@anondjdan), and ["DJ KYOKO TIME"](https://mastodon.sdf.org/@dj_kyoko) on aNONradio.net's [OpenMic](https://anonradio.net/openmic/), and in the past, "DJ Kate's Tales From The Crate" and "DJ KYOKO TIME" on [Tilderadio](https://tilderadio.org/).

You can listen to all of my archived livestreams through my [Soundcloud page](https://soundcloud.com/snowdusk) or through my [blog](/anonradio-archive.html).
